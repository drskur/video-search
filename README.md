$ nx run lambda:build

# on packages/infra
$ npm install

# aws credential setup required.
$ cdk deploy PipelineStack

# After deploying the stack, then the CodeCommit repo will be created.
# If you want to deploy this app, you have to push this repo to the CodeCommit repo.
$ git remote add codecommit <CodeCommit-Repo>
$ git push codecommit main
```

## Usage
Just upload video file to s3 that is generated by CDK.
Video file s3 key must follow the following structure.

```
video/myvideo.en-US.mp4
```
- "video" is s3 key prefix for upload to s3. Only the video that include `video` prefix will be triggered by lambda.
- "myvideo" will be the title.
- "en-US" is language code that used by transcribe. Refer this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html). 
- "mp4" is the file's extention. currently only mp4 and mov are supported.

## Search Engine
This sample use [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) for searching subtitle.
In particular, Among non-Latin languages, Korean is only supported (I used [this](https://github.com/lindera-morphology/lindera-tantivy)).
